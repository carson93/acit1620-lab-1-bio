			About Me
		</div>
		
		<p id="desc-box">
			Hi, my name is Carson Xu. I often wonder why my parents gave me such a silly name.
			Unfortunately, there is not too much else interesting about myself. 
			I live an uninteresting life, doing uninteresting things. 
			Like many of you I enjoy video games and computers. 
			I also enjoy cooking, but I have never cooked in my life.
			But enough about me, I will tell you a funny story instead.
		</p>
